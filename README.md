# APCSA-The-Gators-Spring
By Pranav, Aryan, Praveen and Neil


### Running our project

#### Deployed Website:
To view our spring website, just visit this website: https://csa-gators-suit.herokuapp.com/
This website will be updated as we continue to improve our calculator code and add new calculators. As we add more code, our repository in GitHub will be updated. However, this code then needs to be pushed to Heroku for those changes to be reflected on the website.

#### Pull and Run:
In order to run our project, first pull the APCSA-The-Gators-Spring Repo into IntelliJ through a remote. This project uses JDK 15. In order to run the project, run the DemoApplication.java file, and this is located in src>main>java>com.example.demo>DemoApplication.

This is the file path shown in the project directory:

Once the project is done building, you can view the rendering through any browser. Since this project uses SpringBoot, it ports to port 8080. Typing in localhost:8080 in any broswer will let you see the physical rendering of the project.

Currently, this doesn't reflect the actual Gators Project. This is just random code found online and used to practice deployment. Because this project uses both HTML and CSS, this project also allowed us to learn how to integrate the two together.


### Week of 2/8

Our team is focused on creating a new project with a more coherent theme for the web. We will create a series of calculators that will be combined into one large calculator, so we will individually code things like a derivative, integral, and area calculator + many more. Here are the indiviudal assignments below:

#### Aryan: Derivative Calculator, Mean, Median, Mode Calculator, and Trig Calculator.
#### Pranav: Area of 2D Shapes, Volume of 3D Shapes, Conversions
#### Praveen: Graphing Calculator, Systems of Equations Calculator, Basic 4 Function Calculator
#### Neil: Logarithms Calculator, Integral Calculator

We will integrate our project with the scrum team Coconuts. 


### Week of 2/1
Everyone in our Scrum Team was able to install VMWare and run a virtual machine. We all also have IntelliJ Ultimate installed in those VMs and were able to pull the repo and run the Travel Webpage.

[Made JAR File](https://github.com/aryan114/APCSA-The-Gators-Spring/issues/15): We were successfully able to use Maven to create a JAR file. We will be using this JAR file to deploy our project.

[Install IntelliJ Ultimate on VM](https://github.com/aryan114/APCSA-The-Gators-Spring/issues/10): All of us were able to install VMWare and a windows or ubuntu VM where we were able to install IntelliJ Ultimate. We were then able to push the code to the repo through our VMs.

[Get WebServer running on Machine](https://github.com/aryan114/APCSA-The-Gators-Spring/issues/2): We were able to successfully use Spring to run the Travel Webpage on our VMs.
